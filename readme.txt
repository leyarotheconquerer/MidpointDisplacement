Midpoint Displacement

This is an implementation of the Midpoint Displacement noise generation algorithm (also known as the Diamond-Squared Algorithm).

This implementation is by no means perfect, but it does functionally generate square grids and outputs readable uncompressed bitmaps. I may yet come back to this project, but I figured I should post what I have just in case someone wants a sample implementation.
